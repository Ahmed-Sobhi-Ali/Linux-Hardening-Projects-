# 🛡️ Linux System Hardening Projects

This repository provides a collection of hands-on projects focused on hardening Linux systems, specifically Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 (RHEL 9). Each project demonstrates how to reduce attack surfaces, enforce security controls, and apply best practices using native tools and configurations.

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal is to help system administrators, blue teamers, and cybersecurity learners apply real-world hardening techniques that strengthen Linux environments against misuse, misconfiguration, and attacks. The content bridges the gap between basic system administration and proactive security defense.

## 📦 What’s Inside

- Modular, task-oriented hardening projects (e.g., SSH, logging, firewall)
- Real command-line implementations
- Security validation steps
- Minimal, focused documentation per project

## 🔍 Why It Matters

Hardening is a foundational step in securing any infrastructure. These projects simulate realistic scenarios you may encounter in enterprise environments and help you build the mindset and skills needed to secure production Linux systems effectively.

## 👨‍💻 Who Should Use This

- Junior to mid-level Linux administrators
- SOC analysts and defensive security teams
- Cybersecurity students seeking practical exposure

## ✅ How to Use

1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Linux-Hardening-Projects.git
2. Explore each project directory,
    Each project has its own README.md with steps, commands, and notes.

3. Apply and test in a safe lab environment (VMs or test servers)

📌 This repository is a living resource — new projects will be added as new hardening scenarios are explored.

## 👤 About Me

I'm **Ahmed Sobhi Ali**, a cybersecurity specialist with a focus on both offensive and defensive security. I work extensively with Linux systems, SIEMs, EDRs, firewalls, and network analysis tools like Scapy. I combine my background in system administration with a security-first mindset to build resilient and hardened environments. I'm also exploring how to integrate AI into cybersecurity operations — particularly in log generation, detection engineering, and automation using Python. This repository reflects my practical approach to Linux hardening and my belief in learning by doing.
